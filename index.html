    <p>As the Great Salt Lake dries, it reaches a critical juncture. Sustainability models predict that it will continue to dry as long as change is not made to save what little is left of the Lake. As record low water levels continue to drop, important environmental problems come to light.</p>

    <h2>Toxic Dust</h2>

    <p>The Great Salt Lake has long been burdened by an onslaught of Salt Lake City pollution. This often happens in the form of sediment pollution from urban runoff, thermal pollution from industrial practices, etc. Every industrial action gives rise to the amounts of heavy metals within the Great Salt Lake. Because the lake is a terminal lake - meaning it has no output - heavy metals settle within its bed.  
    As the lake dries, however, these metals are released into the air, not only harming Salt Lake City residents’ respiratory and cardiovascular health but creating a loop of environmental degradation. As this meatal-infused dust is put into the air, it acts to warm Salt Lake City’s climate by lowering the reflectivity of snow and ice, lowering the amount of water that actually reaches the Great Salt Lake, expediting its drying.</p>

    <h2>The Brine Shrimp Food Web</h2> 
    <p>
    The Great Salt Lake has long acted as a stopping point along migratory bird routes. A large reason this takes place is because of the prevalence of brine shrimp within the lake. Unfortunately, these shrimp have faced problems with the salinity of the lake. As the lake dries, the water evaporated leaves behind all the salt that was once dissolved in it, greatly increasing the salt content within the remaining water within the lake. This poses a massive threat to the brine shrimp populations within the lake as brine shrimp have a salinity tipping point of around 18%, greatly disturbing the millions of migratory bird populations that rely on the abundance of brine shrimp within the lake. Without change, this massively important food web could experience a colossal trophic cascade.</p>
    <h2>The 2034 Charter</h2> 
    <p>To address the ever-growing threat of the Great Salt Lake’s drying, Utah environmental leaders have put a series of regulatory actions in place. The plan is to restore the lake’s elevation to a sustainable level before the 2034 Winter Olympics take place in Salt Lake City. This includes implementation of split-season leasing to encourage sustainable water use, municipal construction changes to make Salt Lake City buildings more environmentally friendly, and management to evaluate the salinity of the lake. The charter aims to restore the lake through both ecocentric and technocentric methods, ensuring the lake, and the people of Salt Lake Valley last as long as possible.</p>

    <p>When we think about the Great Salt Lake drying up, the environmental impact is clear. However, one of its largest impacts is one you cannot see.
    The lake is the end of the road for three of Utah’s major rivers, collecting water (and everything floating in it) from these rivers without an outlet. Any sediment in these rivers builds up while the water evaporates away, causing its high salinity that made the lake the phenomenon that it is today.?</p>
    <p>
    But it isn’t just salt that collects in the Great Salt Lake. Many naturally occurring metals have made their way into the lake, including arsenic which has become a major focus due to its known toxic nature. As the lake dries out, the risk of these particles entering the air increases, which poses a health risk for residents of Utah.</p>
    <p>
    Dust pollution has many negative effects on the human body. Of the dust produced by the Great Salt Lake, what researchers are concerned most by are PM10 and PM2.5 particles. These aren’t any specific material, but are a classification of particles that are under 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers in diameter respectively. These particles are particularly dangerous because they are small enough to be inhaled and reach deep into the lungs. For smaller particles, it is even possible for them to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>
    Since these particles can be inhaled, they pose many threats to the body’s internal structures. Irritation of the airways and lungs is a key threat, leading to coughing and shortness of breath. These small particles are also often connected to heart issues and general impairment of the lungs.</p>
    <p>
    Specific compounds like arsenic are included within these particles and can lead to their own unique health complications.</p>
    <p>
    Arsenic enters the body and inhibits cellular respiration by binding to and disrupting specific enzymes. This inhibits key parts of the respiration process such as oxidative phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis. Arsenic anions can also replace phosphorus anions bound to ATP in the cell, which causes the loss of high energy phosphate bonds.</p>
    <p>
    Overall, arsenic inhibits energy production in the body, inhibiting communication in the brain (numbness in the limbs, tingling sensations, confusion) and disrupting the heart (irregular heartbeat and increased risk of cardiovascular disease). Arsenic is also linked to DNA damage, causing cancer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Despite the possibilities, it is important to consider that data on the Great Salt Lake’s dust pollution is scarce and hard to produce. While we can’t currently  determine the effect the lake has on air quality and what pollutants come from the lake, we can recognize that there is a developing problem with the lake and public health, emphasizing the need to address and reverse the increasingly low water levels in the Great Salt Lake.</p>

    <p>The Great Salt Lake has existed for thousands of years, in the northwest corner of Utah. Formed as a remanent of Lake Bonneville, it receives water from several different rivers flowing throughout the state. Over time, the lake has gradually become a unique body of water crucial to the region. Today, it holds a special place in the region’s ecosystem, interacting with life, communities, and the environment. Depending on where you are, you may have hear of the Great Salt Lake as a super salty body of water, one of the saltiest in the entire world. To be specific, the Great Salt Lake is hypersaline environment, meaning it has an extremely high concentration of salt, far exceeding that of the ocean. While the high salt concentrations mean most aquatic life can’t survive in the water, it does not mean that the lake has no life. On contrary, the lake supports a very unique ecosystem that can’t be found anywhere else. Countless organisms rely on or use the lake for survival. The salty environment supports halophilic organisms that have adapted to its conditions. While creatures found elsewhere cannot survive in the environment, the organisms that do live there have evolved specialized mechanisms to adapted to the special ecological niches of the lake. But, as you may have also heard, the lake is shrinking.
    Water levels have been dropping for decades, and this depletion isn’t just a local problem. So why should we care about it? Well, lake drying up isn’t the only issue, but rather has a large impact on the entire ecosystem and all the life that depend on it. Once those are taken into account, the Great Salt Lake may become more important more than you think. As water levels are reach historical lows in recent years and the ecosystem and all the unique organisms face the crisis of disappearing, the problem becomes extremely huge.</p>
    <h3>Why Is the Great Salt Lake So Important?</h3>
    <p>
    The Great Salt Lake an ecological hotspot. Millions of birds, from hundreds of different species, migrate across the Pacific Flyway and stop at by the lake to rest every year. These birds use the surrounding lands to rest their body and find food, like brine shrimp or brine flies, to replenish their energy as fat reserves before continuing their journey. Although the lake is only temporarily stop for the birds, it is an extremely important support for them. To these tens of millions of birds, the lake is a necessary stop to recover their condition and allow them to continue their journey. If they can’t rest by the lake, they won’t be able to survive their journey. But now, as the lake water shrinks, the birds are losing those very habitats they depend on. 
    But birds aren’t the only thing that depend on the lake. The lake ecosystem is home to many other organisms that thrive in the lake’s salt levels. Brine shrimp and brine flies are just some of the most prominent residents of the lake habitat. They are the food source of these migratory birds. While they may seem as insignificant organisms, don’t let their tiny size deceive their influence. These tiny creatures are the foundation of the entire lake’s food web.</p>
    <h2>How Is Water Depletion Affecting Wildlife?</h2>
    <p>
    As the water in the Great Salt Lake depletes, wildlife that depends on the lake find it harder and harder to survive. </p>
    <h3>Brine Shrimp and Brine Flies</h3>
    <p>Brine shrimp are a big deal for the lake ecosystem, but it may surprise you to find that they are also a also big deal for the local economy. The local aquaculture industry also harvests these shrimps to make fish food, thus supporting the economy. Of course, their most important role is still in the lake’s food web. In the Great Salt Lake, brine shrimps are a keystone species in the food web and support the entire ecosystem. They are primary consumers that feed on algae and other microorganisms like phytoplankton. When they are eaten by birds and other predators’ energy can be transferred up the food chain. Without them, the entire ecosystem would collapse. However, as the lake shrinks, it is becoming more and more likely that they are going to disappear. The declining water levels, means the salinity of the lake rises. Brine shrimp are adapted to the high salinity levels of the lake, due to osmotic regulation and specialized ion channels that allow them to maintain a balanced internal salt level. However, when the salt concentrations become too high, their populations suffer. The shrimp can’t reproduce at exceedingly high salinity and the high salinity also affects some enzymatic function and cellular processes causing their population to drops.
    Brine flies are the other keystone species in the lake ecosystem. They too are consumed by visiting birds. Their larvae feed on microbial mats underwater, but decreasing water levels also expose these mats to air and cause them to dry out. This causes the flies lose their breeding grounds and numbers. Fewer brine flies also mean less food for the birds.</p>
    <h3>Migratory Birds Are Losing Their Habitat</h3>
    <p>With the lake’s shorelines are retreating, wetland areas also dry up. Migratory birds including the American avocet, Western sandpipers, and California gulls use these wetland areas to rest and find food. In their migration, they use their stored energy reserves in the form of fat. The lake is a place for them to rest and replenish their energy. With the loss of wetland areas, the birds have less places to rest and prepare for the next stage of their migration journey. If the lake doesn’t support enough brine shrimp and brine flies, the birds find it even harder to find food and replenish their energy and build enough reserves to keep going. Without enough food, the birds become too weak to make the next part of their journey. Many more die because of this, and those that survive might have less offspring. Entire bird populations could decline as a result of the Great Salt Lake’s decline.</p>
    <h2>What’s Happening to Other Species?</h2>
    <p>
    These effects don’t affect brine shrimp, flies, and birds, but reach out to the ecosystem itself.</p>
    <h3>Aquatic Life Is Struggling</h3>
    <p>Many species adapted to the Great Salt Lake environment cannot adapt to the rapid changes in the environment. Many of the lake’s fish and microorganisms already struggle to survive in the lake abnormally saline conditions, but can still manage to adapt. However, as the as the rate of evaporation begins to far exceed the replenishing, the increasingly salty conditions are surpassing these species limits. This continues the chain reaction as microorganisms that break own organic matter that enters the lake become negatively affected as the lake becomes less habitable. This then affects nutrient cycling and damages the lake’s ability to support life.</p>
    <h3>Plant Life and the Shoreline Are in Danger</h3>
    <p>Plants and other wetland vegetation like Saltgrass also struggle to survive in the collapsing ecosystem. These plants are generally halophytic, with adaptations to survive in saline environments through salt glands to excrete or compartmentalize salt. They face problems as the shrinking lake increases salinity too far, dry up habitats, expose toxic dust and soil, and allows the introduction of invasive competitor plants. This further exacerbates the problem as plants help prevent soil erosion by the shoreline. Their roots bind the soil, keeping it stable. Without these plants, the soil will erode, causing even further habitat loss. This is just another link in the ecosystem collapsing chain effect caused by water depletion.</p>
    <h2>What’s Being Done to Help the Great Salt Lake?</h2>
    <p>While the situation seems grim, and really is problematic, there are ongoing conservation efforts working to improve the situation. Organizations like the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources are working to monitor wildlife populations and protect these habitats and policy makers are discussing recovery solutions to restore the lake’s water along with the species in the ecosystem.
    However, this task faces many difficulties. Utah is a cold desert, with minimal rainfall and water, but many sectors that all use the limited supply. Especially as climate change contribute to increasingly harsh conditions and drought, water becomes an extremely scarce resource. Fortunately, it is not too late. The water problem at the lake is receiving attention, but it is imperative to take action now before the situation deteriorates. If we don’t, the we risk the complete collapse of Great Salt Lake’s ecosystem that supports millions of migratory birds, specialized organisms, and is completely interconnected with the region.</p>
    <h2>How the Great Salt Lake Connects Globally</h2>
    <p>The Great Salt Lake influence exceeds its own environment. It is a part of a larger ecological system spanning North America and even further regions. Therefore, its decline devastates biodiversity, migratory bird species, environment health in other locations.
    Not just the Great Salt Lake. Many other bodies of water similarly face dire circumstances. Water depletion in the Great Salt Lake is not an isolated case, but rather a ubiquitous problem faced in many parts of the world as climate changes and humans use more water. As water bodies receive less water due to these reasons and inflow exceeds outflow, they shrink. Without a place for minerals to go, salinity also increases. The Aral Sea in Central Asia, Lake Urmia in Iran, and so many more have and are presently facing similar challenges. To protect all of these rivers and lakes that support countless lives, from humans to animals, we need to view water with the intent to protect our ecosystems.<p>

    <p>A student-led effort to document the drying of the Great Salt Lake and inspire action through education and storytelling.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-body">
    <h2>Why We Care</h2>
    <p>The Great Salt Lake is at the heart of Utah's identity and ecology. For thousands of years it has sustained migratory birds, supported indigenous communities, and shaped the climate of the Wasatch Front. Today, it faces an existential threat, and most people don't even know it.</p>
    <p>This blog was created as a school project to raise awareness about a crisis happening in our own backyard. The lake has lost more than 70% of its historic water volume, and the exposed lakebed, called a playa, releases toxic dust that blankets communities across northern Utah.</p>

    <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
    <p>Through research, writing, and reporting, we aim to make the science accessible to everyone. We cover topics ranging from the lake's ecology and the wildlife that depends on it, to the political and agricultural decisions that have diverted its water supply, to the grassroots movements fighting to save it.</p>
    <p>We believe that telling this story clearly and compellingly is one of the most important things we can do. If more people understand the stakes, more people will demand change. Change is still possible.</p>

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>You can help by sharing these articles, supporting water conservation organizations in Utah, and contacting your elected representatives. We'd love to hear from you.</p>
